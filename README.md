# gmd40
This is a C program to initially increment up and down the channel on the Hughes and Kettner GrandMesiter Deluxe 40 amplifier.

i am also porting the original panel to Linux as the author kindly sent me the source.
i will update this file with full attributions and thanks etc

i'm dealing with a health issue but sitting in front of the computer with a guitar on my lap testing all this stuff is a great way to take my mind away from that ! and noodle on the guitar and test my coding.

The panel is written in Lua so, whilst i'm an experienced programmer ? I've not used Lua before. However, it's quite intuitive so i don't foresee any actual Lua issues. 

What i do see is issues getting it to work on Linux - not because Linux has issues, no, but because of the many Linux "flavours" out there.

My initial focus will be to get the panel working with controller specifically for myHughes and Kettner Grand Meister Deluxe 40 (GMD40) because i have the GMD40 and that's the only amp i can test this on.

So it's likely i'll comment out specific code that refers to the 36 and/or the BS200.

If i get sh!t working on the GMD40 ? Cool. Then i'll release spearate 36 and BS200 versions but obviously i can't test those so it will rely upon input and feedback - party on dude, soz !! - from you guys n gals.

Peter.
